              <div class="custom-scrollbar-css p-2">
                <p class="font-italic">In March 2020, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Steven Spielberg was watching his 103-year-old father, Arnold, deteriorate. After growing distant when the filmmaker, now 75, was in his 20s and early 30s, father and son had reconnected and become close. They lived near each other in Pacific Palisades, and Steven would go to Arnold’s house to watch movies, listen to music and hang out on the patio. Steven’s mother, Leah, had died in 2017 at 97, and by August 2020, Arnold would be gone, too. That spring, as Arnold’s condition worsened, Steven began to grieve.


                  “Even before my dad left, I was missing the thought that I wouldn’t just be able to drive up to his house, as I did all the time,” Spielberg says. “For all of us under the yoke of COVID, not really knowing how bad it was going to get, all of us were very reflective about the safety of our families, but also about where we’ve been and where we want to go, how we want to continue surviving.”
                  
                  Spielberg has spent much of his more than 50-year directing career mining the fable of his own family, but it had been typically delivered in crowd-pleasing genre films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. In 2020, he realized he was ready to tell the version of that story without the alien spaceships and 700-year-old knights. “I started seriously thinking, if I had to make one movie I haven’t made yet, something that I really want to do on a very personally atomic level, what would that be?” Spielberg says. “And there was only one story I really wanted to tell.”
                  
                  That movie, The Fabelmans, is the story of Spielberg’s childhood and the dissolution of his parents’ marriage, with Michelle Williams playing a version of his mother named Mitzi, Paul Dano as a character named Burt based on his father and Gabriel LaBelle as the family’s son, Sammy. When Burt and Mitzi take Sammy to the movies for the first time at age 5, to see the slightly too-scary-for-him Greatest Show on Earth, they ignite in the boy a fascination with film and cameras, toys and tools that Sammy will train on his own family.
                  
                  The Fabelmans is Spielberg’s most vulnerable movie, and at 75, he considers it “the first coming-of-age story I’ve ever told.”
                  
                  “My life with my mom and dad taught me a lesson, which I hope this film in a small way imparts,” he says. “Which is, when does a young person in a family start to see his parents as human beings? In my case, because of what happened between the ages of 7 and 18, I started to appreciate my mom and dad not as parents but as real people.”
                  
                  
                  
                  Shot in faithfully reconstructed versions of Spielberg’s childhood homes in New Jersey, Arizona and California and with re-creations of scenes from 8mm and 16mm movies he had made as a kid, The Fabelmans, which Universal Pictures will release in theaters Nov. 11, is itself a kind of home movie, albeit a more than $40 million one from America’s most famous filmmaker and starring award-winning actors. “It’s a very unzipped thing to do,” Williams says of Spielberg laying his family history bare. “To let everybody in like this? That would scare me.”
                  
                  
                  A couple of people who weren’t scared of The Fabelmans were Arnold and Leah. Before Spielberg’s parents died, he says, “They were actually nagging me, ‘When are you going to tell that story about our family, Steve?’ ” (Anybody he met before 1976 calls Spielberg “Steve.”) “And so this was something they were very enthusiastic about.”
                  
                  Spielberg’s father was an accomplished engineer who worked long hours for GE and RCA. His mother was a gregarious concert pianist and painter who later owned a kosher restaurant on Pico Boulevard in West L.A. called The Milky Way. Some of the moments in The Fabelmans that seem like they might be creative flourishes — like when Mitzi climbs a tree on a camping trip or buys a monkey as a pet — are things Leah really did. She wasn’t just the matriarch of Steven and his younger sisters, Anne, Nancy and Sue, she was also their household’s Peter Pan. “Arnold was methodical, very sweet, very quiet,” says Kristie Macosko Krieger, Spielberg’s longtime producer. “Leah was fun and really gushy with her kids. Not a typical parent. She was just her own independently fierce spirit.” Spielberg’s parents, Macosko Krieger says, are “the brain and the heart, married inside of Steven.”

                  Spielberg almost never writes his own movies, with the rare exceptions of the screenplays for Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001). In Tony Kushner, who has written four of Spielberg’s films over the past 17 years — The Fabelmans, West Side Story, Lincoln and Munich — the director has found one of the most important collaborators of his career. It was in 2004 in Malta, on the set of Munich, that Spielberg first shared with Kushner a defining moment in his childhood. The director described how as a teenager, he had discovered something shocking about his family while editing home movies he had shot of them. “The camera saw something that was sitting in plain sight,” Kushner says. “Something that no one in the family saw because they weren’t looking for it, or because they had a stake in not seeing it. I was so moved by that story. Immediately I said, ‘Someday you’re going to have to make a film about this.’ ” What teenage Steven saw, and how he made sense of it, is the crux of The Fabelmans and better left unspoiled until 75-year-old Steven’s camera reveals it. Over the years, as Kushner and Spielberg would talk about Spielberg’s childhood, Kushner would take notes with the idea that, eventually, they would organize them into a movie.
                  
                  In 2019, Spielberg and Kushner were in Brooklyn in rehearsals for West Side Story when they had an argument over a creative decision on the musical — a not uncommon part of their collaboration, Kushner says. “I might as well call it a fight,” the screenwriter says. “It was a fight. And he knew I was really upset, and afterward he called me and said, ‘Why don’t we get together and start looking at our notes for The Fabelmans and talking through some more memories?’ I thought, ‘That’s sweet. He’s letting me know that we’re still friends.’ ”
                  
                  
                  During lockdown, Spielberg and Kushner began spending three to four hours a day together on Zoom three days a week. After Arnold died in August, they progressed to an outline and began writing scenes. Kushner, who had never worked with a co-writer before, was skeptical. “I wasn’t at all sure that this was going to happen or that it was a good idea even,” the screenwriter says. “Steven, who unlike me is really most happy when he’s working, said, ‘Let’s just go on Zoom and try to write it and see what happens.’ And I couldn’t think of any way out of it. So I said, ‘Sure.’ ” Kushner would try to cancel meetings, and Spielberg would keep him on task, Macosko Krieger says, partly for his own emotional reasons. “Steve needed to work through all of his grief, his father dying, and how he was now contemplating life without either of his parents,” she says.
                  
                  The Fabelmans has lots of Easter eggs in it for Spielberg fans — in scenes shot by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, there are images of boys racing along suburban streets on their bikes and siblings huddled in a closet that are reminiscent of 1982’s E.T. But Spielberg wanted the movie to work for a viewer who has no idea who he is, and he and Kushner approached the script as an epic about a family. “It’s not a farewell and it’s not a victory lap,” Kushner says. “We said at the beginning, this is only worth making if somebody who didn’t know that Steven had made it could enjoy this just as a movie.” In December 2020, they turned in their first draft to Macosko Krieger, lightning speed by Kushner’s usual timeline. By July, Spielberg would be standing in a kitchen identical to the one he grew up in Arizona, trying not to fall apart in front of his cast and crew.

                  “Hey, Doodle,” says Dano. “Go to bed.” The actor, 38, is on Zoom from home in Brooklyn, trying to describe what it was like playing Spielberg’s dad, but real-life fatherhood is getting in the way. His 4-year-old daughter with partner Zoe Kazan has plopped into his lap. “You can say hi, then it’s bedtime. That’s my friend, Steven,” Dano says. Spielberg, on Zoom from his home in the Palisades, sets down the unlit cigar in his hand and waves. “You can call me Steve … or Stevie,” Spielberg says. Dano’s daughter looks intently into the screen at the bearded man wearing a plaid newsboy cap and horn-rimmed glasses. “I may call you Steve,” she says. “Great choice!” Spielberg replies.

                  In casting the actors who play his parents, Spielberg relied on instinct and on the surprising intimacy of Zoom, in conversations not unlike this one, which happened in early October. “Beyond their bodies of work, I just had a kind of familiarity with Paul and with Michelle,” Spielberg says. Dano is best known for playing misanthropes and weirdos, like the antagonist in 2007’s There Will Be Blood and the Riddler in this year’s The Batman. But based on what industry friends had told Spielberg about Dano’s offscreen temperament, the director thought the actor might be perfect to capture the quiet decency of his dad. In early 2021, Dano, who was visiting family in California, got a text from his agent that Spielberg wanted a Zoom meeting with him. Unusually nervous, he shaved and put in contact lenses, which he almost never wears. “I was like, ‘I’ve got to look good,’ ” Dano says. “And I remember sitting down at the computer, and suddenly just everything went calm.” When Spielberg explained what The Fabelmans was about, Dano says, “My heart did leap. I just could see it.” Spielberg could see it, too. “I certainly didn’t want to come on my first meeting with Paul and be a little too familiar,” Spielberg says. “But there was something so evocative of my dad. Ten minutes after the Zoom, I was choking. I was holding back my emotion.”
                  
                  
                  In casting an actress to play his mother, Spielberg was thinking of Williams’ Oscar-nominated performance as an intelligent, discontented young wife in the 2011 romantic drama Blue Valentine. For Williams, 42, a four-time Oscar nominee, a role in a Spielberg film represented the height of her profession (as for so many actors across generations). When she was starting out as an actress on The WB teen drama Dawson’s Creek, “his name was a refrain that I would use, and I would say to my best friend, Busy [Philipps], ‘Oh, when is Steven Spielberg going to call me?’ ” Twenty years later, he finally did, by Zoom, and she dressed up for it, wearing a dress with a round collar. Spielberg noted that his mother would have worn something similar and began explaining The Fabelmans and the role of Mitzi. “As it was dawning on me what was happening, I had to stop and ask him, ‘Wait, are you asking me to play your mother?’ ” Williams says. “And he said, ‘Yes, that is what I’m asking.’ To not only be asked to play a part in one of his movies, but to be asked to play his beloved mother … it’s like being taken inside somebody’s heart, to be trusted with this most personal material.”

                  In March 2021, LaBelle, now 19, then a little-known Vancouver actor, had just shot a pilot in L.A. when his manager asked him to put himself on tape for a movie with little available information. “I knew that it took place in the ’60s, and I knew that my character’s name was ‘Teenage Sammy,’ ” LaBelle says. “I taped it with my dad, just like any other thing, and I throw it out there. And then my manager tells me, ‘Yeah, I think it’s a Spielberg movie. And Teenage Sammy actually means teenage Steven.’ At first I felt like, ‘Oh, well, why wouldn’t you tell me that?!’ But obviously it was better I didn’t know.” It would be a few more months before LaBelle ended up on his Zoom with Spielberg, to audition with an emotional scene between father and son. His was a slightly less intimate call than Dano’s and Williams’ initial conversations. “I see at the bottom of the Zoom thing, participants, like 40 people,” LaBelle says, including casting director Cindy Tolan, who had also cast West Side Story for Spielberg. Thanks to the enthusiasm and vulnerability he showed, LaBelle got the role and quickly turned the tables on Spielberg, asking to Zoom with him again. “It was no longer me interviewing you, you were interviewing me,” Spielberg says to LaBelle. “I was your subject, and I was going to answer anything you asked me because this was your research.”
                  
                  
                  Spielberg rounded out his cast with Seth Rogen as a close family friend, Judd Hirsch as an eccentric uncle, Jeannie Berlin as his paternal grandmother and Julia Butters, Keeley Karsten and Sophia Kopera as his three sisters. All of the actors had access to Spielberg and his sisters for their questions as well as home movies to view. Dano ordered and built a crystal radio set to feel something of the magic Arnold had felt around electronics. Spielberg taught LaBelle how to use the 1950s- and ’60s-era 8mm and 16mm cameras the props department secured, making sure that they were loaded with real film and that what LaBelle shot was developed. Williams wore some of Leah’s jewelry, including a charm bracelet that had pictures of each of her four children. “My mom loved bling,” Spielberg says.
                  
                  The Fabelmans is Spielberg’s portrait of himself as a budding young artist, but it’s also a look at what it was to be a woman in America in the ’60s, as some were beginning to question whether there was another role for them in the world other than housewife and mother. “After I finished the script, I said to my husband, ‘They let her live as a woman, not just as a mother,’ ” says Williams, who has just given birth to her third child. “Everything that she did, she did completely.” While writing, Spielberg and Kushner, whose mother was also a musician who put her career on hold to raise children, talked about the sacrifices their moms made as artists. “It’s that question of a woman’s sense of self-ownership, self-possession,” Kushner says. The monkey Leah brought home, Spielberg says, “was a grand distraction, but it was also a therapeutic companion for my mom, who was really at that time in our lives going through a major depression.” There’s one line in the film, borrowed from real life, in which one of Spielberg’s sisters asks the teenage filmmaker to make more movies with roles for girls, instead of just the Westerns and war stories he’s been filming with his friends. With the role of Mitzi Fabelman, “he sure did,” says Williams. “I mean, I’ve never come across a part like this.”
                  
                  
                  Spielberg also includes scenes of antisemitic bullies targeting Sammy when the family moves to a WASPy California community. “Whether you’re Jewish or not, many kids know what it’s like to be bullied,” Spielberg says. “Because I wasn’t good at sports and was a little bit of an outsider — or maybe a lot of an outsider — I had a lot of experiences being bullied.” The specifically antisemitic bullying that emerged in California served as an awakening for Spielberg. “My parents always talked about the Holocaust, and I’m not comparing the Holocaust to antisemitic bullying, but [the Holocaust] was an abstraction to me,” Spielberg says. “When I went through that semester of antisemitic bullying, suddenly those stories found a personal meaning for me. And that did shape a lot of the stories I would tell in the future.” Sixty years later, Spielberg still considers himself an outsider. “Whether you’re outside or inside of Hollywood, how a person feels about him or herself is a very personal thing, and it can’t be camouflaged based on acceptance in a group,” he says. “It’s a lifelong struggle.”

                  Production on The Fabelmans took 59 days beginning in summer 2021, primarily in California. Spielberg’s longtime collaborators came aboard, including Kaminski, who has worked with him since 1993’s Schindler’s List; production designer Rick Carter, with him since the 1980s NBC series Amazing Stories; film editor Michael Kahn, who first joined him to make Close Encounters; and composer John Williams, who has been with Spielberg since his 1974 feature debut, The Sugarland Express. “We all felt protective of him,” says Macosko Krieger, who started as Spielberg’s assistant in the ’90s. “We knew that he was putting his heart out there for people to see for the first time.”
                  
                  
                  Carter’s department found toy soldiers just like the ones Spielberg had played with as a child, and the precise kitchenette, with a round table, that the Spielberg family had in Arizona. “To come to work every morning and walk on a set that is an exact replica of the house I grew up in created a level of nostalgia verging on grief,” Spielberg says. “It was a healthy kind of grieving.” There were points in the production, however, where he slipped back into his childhood self and was overcome. “Those were the hard moments,” he says. “Those were the moments where after I said ‘Cut,’ I’d have to leave the set. And inevitably, I’d suddenly see Paul coming around the corner, and he would just grab me and hang onto me. And the same thing with Michelle. She’d see me putting my hands up and say, ‘I need a break.’ And I’d go off, and she’d find me.” While he was happy to accept comfort from Dano and Williams, Spielberg wanted to shield LaBelle from some of his emotion. “I didn’t want to put too much burden on Gabe because he’s new to making movies,” Spielberg says. “Suddenly, he’s got a director that he can look over to, hoping for some kind of confidence and experience. And the director’s eyes are filled with tears and he’s just trying to keep his lower lip from bobbing up and down too much. And I felt bad for Gabe to have to throw him into that little bit of self-indulgence.” It was often the scenes of familial happiness that stopped Spielberg, like one in which the Fabelmans are singing the Russian folk song “Kalinka” around a campfire.

                  On set, the storyteller was very much in charge. When shooting, Kushner says, Spielberg likes to show up early, before everybody else starts, when it’s quiet. “He walks around with a notebook and points at things with his fingers and doesn’t talk to anybody,” Kushner says. “He’s working it out. I used to think, why doesn’t he do that the night before? I think it’s a way of keeping it exciting for himself. The unexpected gives him challenges that otherwise, maybe it would all get a little too easy for him. He’s made a lot of movies.”
                  
                  Much of this film shows Sammy developing as a filmmaker, shooting his own 8mm opuses, and Spielberg re-created some of his old films shot for shot, though he eventually trimmed some of those sequences. “I was already improving on my work as a 12-year-old and 16-year-old, and I realized that if I re-created any more of my home movies, they wouldn’t look like some kid who was just learning the ropes,” Spielberg says. “They would look like somebody who has ridden the ropes.”
                  
                  After shooting one key scene of the family on a camping trip in which Sammy is filming his mother dancing in the headlights of a car, the crew was about to wrap when Spielberg asked them to turn the shot around. He wanted to show the shadows Williams was casting on the faces of the actors who were watching her, mute. “We were out in a forest and everybody got completely quiet,” Kushner says. “His sister Anne was sitting next to me, and we watched the shadow moving across these three guys. When Steven said, ‘Cut!,’ Anne turned to me and said, ‘My brother is very talented.’ ”
                  
                  
                  Spielberg was constantly checking in with his sisters, giving them every draft of the script and including their memories. “He was nervous about what his sisters would think. He was nervous about what the world would think,” says Macosko Krieger. His sisters Sue and Nancy watched The Fabelmans in a screening room in New York over the summer. When Spielberg walked in as the credits were rolling, “It was like somebody had run over their dog,” Spielberg says. “We just turned around and walked out. They needed a lot of time to process this. This was a deeply cathartic — not traumatizing — but cathartic moment for them.”
                  
                  Spielberg’s movies and his personal life have always been intertwined. It was after making E.T., and working with the child actors on that film, that he decided he wanted to become a father. “I couldn’t imagine going another three or four years without having kids,” Spielberg says. Today, he has seven children and six grandchildren.
                  
                  The Fabelmans debuted in September at the Toronto Film Festival, where it won the audience award, traditionally an Oscar bellwether. Though he has had films premiere out of competition at festivals, this was Spielberg’s first time formally entering one. As the filmmaker whose 1975 movie, Jaws, spawned the era of the wide-release blockbuster, Spielberg has not historically relied on the slow-build marketing strategy of the festival circuit. The Fabelmans, however, is different. “It needed a little more care than just releasing it wide in 4,000 theaters,” Macosko Krieger says.
                  
                  
                  Though Spielberg recently handed off Indiana Jones to director James Mangold, he in no way considers The Fabelmans valedictory. One thing he’d still like to make, for instance, is a Western. “He’s not done,” says Macosko Krieger. “Oh, no, no, no. They’re going to pry a movie camera out of his hands. He was put on earth to make films. He’ll continue to tell great stories for the rest of his life.”
                  
                  By the time The Fabelmans ends, Spielberg’s parents are divorced, and they would both remarry. But they both lived long lives, and eventually outlived their second partners. In their later years, Leah and Arnold became close friends. “My sisters and I constantly marvel at the fact that very few kids get their parents back after a divorce,” Spielberg says. “And yet, we were able to get ours back.”</p>

              <div class="custom-scrollbar-css p-2">
                <p class="font-italic">Lewis Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) was arguably the first, and inarguably, amongst the very best anti-war movies ever made. Adapted from Erich Maria Remarque’s 1928 novel, which Remarque based on his own experiences as a German soldier in the trenches of World War I, the film went on to win Oscars for best picture and best director. All Quiet on the Western Front was remade for American television in 1979, with Richard Thomas and Ernest Borgnine.

                  But it has taken nearly a century since the publication of Remarque’s book for it to be adapted in German, the language in which it was written. Partly, this has to do with the book’s history in the Third Reich. The Nazis banned and burned copies of All Quiet on the Western Front for its “treasonous”, and decidedly unheroic, depiction of war. Remarque’s story follows Paul Bäumer, a student who, inspired by his teacher’s patriotic speeches, leads his class to volunteer to serve on the front. But that patriotic fervor does not survive the first day of battle. What follows is a brutal, and shockingly honest, depiction of the horror and trauma of war and the toll, both physical and psychological, that it takes on the young men who fight.
                  
                  
                
                  Capturing that horror, and giving a very unheroic cinematic vision of war, was one of the main goals for director Edward Berger in his new, German-language adaption of All Quiet on the Western Front. The film, which premieres Sept.12 at the Toronto Film Festival, stars newcomer Felix Kammerer as Bäumer, Albrecht Schuch (System Crasher) as his brother-in-arms Stanislaus Katczinsky, and star Daniel Brühl (Rush, Inglourious Basterds) as a German diplomat negotiating his country’s surrender in the war’s final days.
                  
                  All Quiet on the Western Front was just named Germany’s official entry for the 2023 Oscars in the Best International Feature category. After its TIFF premiere, the film will go out in select theaters in Germany on Sept. 29, in the U.K from Oct. 14 and after an exclusive engagement at the Paris Theater in New York from Oct.7, in select theaters in the US from Oct.14. It bows on Netflix worldwide Oct.28.
                  
                  Why remake All Quiet on the Western Front and why now?
                  
                  Well, it is the first German adaptation of the book and that was a big reason for me to do it. I watch a lot of American and English films, as we all do, and occasionally there is a war movie or even an anti-war movie among them. And I find them extremely entertaining. But I feel they never show my perspective, the perspective I have as a German. Not that of America, that saved Europe from fascism, or England, which was attacked and drawn into a war against their will, whose soldiers returned home, certainly traumatized and psychologically broken, but celebrated as heroes, [where] the war is an event that enters the national psyche as something that the society is in part proud of. For us, it’s the exact opposite. In our national psyche, there is nothing but guilt, horror, terror and destruction.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  And we have ourselves to blame for that. It’s not like someone attacked us, it’s our own fault. I think that makes us look at war differently. There’s nothing heroic about it, nothing great about it. I inherited that perspective from my great-grandparents, from my grandparents, from my parents. My children will inherit it from me and their children will have it from them.
                  
                  So doing a war film, as a German, means looking at it differently. There are no heroes in war. Every death is a terrible death. I thought sharing this perspective might be interesting for other countries as well, countries that might see war differently.
                  
                  Of course, when we made the film we couldn’t have anticipated what would be happening in Europe right now, with a war going on against Russia. But, somehow, we seem to keep forgetting what war is. The topic never gets old. Which is why now is the right time to show this film.

                  The book and previous adaptations, focus entirely on the trenches, on the war on the front. In your version you have a second narrative, that of the German diplomats, led by Daniel Brühl’s character, trying to negotiate a peace treaty with the Allies. Why did you add that?
                  
                  Well, the book is 100 years old now. The war is 100 years old. Viewers today simply don’t have the historical context anymore. I thought it was important to provide that context in order to capture the soul, the essence, of the book. Also, to put the story in a historical perspective. Because when Erich Ramirez Maria Remarque wrote All Quiet on the Western Front, the war wasn’t over. The Second World War started exactly there, at the end of the first one, at those peace negotiations, with the defeat of the Germans who couldn’t get over it, who started saying: we actually won, but we were forced to surrender because of these people who betrayed us. Erich Maria Remarque didn’t know World War 2 was coming [he wrote the book in 1928] but I think adding this context is in the spirit of his original novel. The fact, unimaginable at the time, after these horrific battles, all this destruction, that 20 years later there would be another war, with the same people fighting.
                  
                  
                  We have become so accustomed to seeing war depicted on screen, Sam Mendes‘ 1917 will still be in many people’s minds. How difficult was it for you to find a new visual style to tell this story?
                  
                  Once I took up this perspective, of the German soldier, it wasn’t difficult. Because it is a new perspective. We’ve had the American, the English perspective on war. But, somehow, the German perspective on these battles, on this devastation, hadn’t been seen before. I felt relatively free, visually. We have a hero who is not a hero at all, just a protagonist, who guides us through the film.
                  
                  For every visual decision, it was important to me to put the viewer in the shoes of Paul Bäumer, the main character. I wanted to make the feel physically tangible as if you were going through it with him. To almost feel it physically. Every decision made with the camera was driven by that intent. Every angle, every position. What does Paul Bäumer feel right now? That’s what we wanted to capture.

                  At the beginning, the first scene, before we meet Paul, it’s done like a single take, as if the audience is running onto the battlefield. Later we used more editing, or more deliberate editing, to reflect Paul’s inner condition. Taking the perspective of 1917, which is shot a bit like an adventure movie, well an English director can do that. A German can’t. For a German film, it would be the wrong approach.
                  
                  One scene I felt was extraordinary was after the first battle, when you show the aftermath, how the bodies are piled up, the uniforms stripped off, and the send back to be washed, mended, and handed out to the next group of soldiers.
                  
                  
                  That actually comes directly from the novel. I thought: what is Erich Maria Remarque trying to do here? What is he trying to say? For me it is how a generation of boys were just devastated by the war, they returned home no longer able to communicate with the people there. The solidier loses his soul in this war. He just becomes a machine, because he has to, to protect himself. That’s the machinery of war and I thought it was important to establish that theme, visually, right at the beginning of the film. You see the uniforms, piled up on the trucks, washed like on an assembly line. And the machine keeps going, feeding off the next generation of boys coming through, being sent to the slaughter.

                  Daniel Brühl in ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’ COURTESY OF TIFF
                  There are several well-known German actors in the film, including Daniel Brühl, but I’d never before seen Felix Kammerer, who plays Paul Bäumer. Where did you find him?
                  
                  The novel is so well-know, it’s really iconic, so it was important for me that the audience come to this figure of Paul Bäumer without any preconceptions. We wanted to find someone new, someone, who had not yet been discovered. Felix Kammerer is a terrific actor who works at the Burg Theater in Austria. He’s Austrian. As luck would have it, the wife of the film’s producer also works there. She sent me a photo of Felix and I thought: his face was already so old-fashioned and so classic looking, so pure and so innocent. We continued to cast for another 3-4-5 months. I saw some 500 young actors. And we invited Felix back again and again. And every time, he just got better and better, just growing into the role. At one point, it was clear, it had to be him. It was a real discovery.
                  
                  
                  Speaking of discovery, German audiences know Albrecht Schuch, who plays Bäumer’s comrade Stanislaus Katczinsky, from System Crasher (2019) and Berlin, Alexanderplatz (2020). But this film might be the one that gets him noticed internationally.
                  
                  It’s a bit surprising he hasn’t already been discovered [by Hollywood]. But Albrecht transforms with every film, each time it’s like a new discovery. You barely recognize him. With Stanislaus, he just walked in with this performance, this earthy, potato-eater type.

                  Do you think it will be a challenge to get international audiences to empathize with German soldiers in a war movie?
                  
                  That’s a great question, and it’s one I’ve been grappling with it for a long time. I definitely don’t want this film to be understood as excusing German actions in the war, quite the opposite. And I don’t want people to think: oh look at those poor soldiers.
                  
                  In Germany, maybe differently than in other countries, we are much more critical of our own history. We rightly look at our history critically and try to understand it somehow, to process it. We are very critical of the military. Right now, that’s causing problems with the war in Ukraine because just sending weapons to another country, or intervening in a war in any way, is hugely controversial in Germany. It would be horrifying for me if any country saw this movie as excusing the actions of German soldiers in war.

              <div class="custom-scrollbar-css p-2">
                <p class="font-italic">Oscar-winning Mexican filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu is no stranger to the Tokyo International Film Festival. He first visited the city with his debut feature film, Amores Perros (2000), and went on to win the festival’s prizes for both best director and best film. In 2006, he was back in the Japanese capital to shoot major portions of his globe-spanning, Oscar-nominated drama Babel, living with his entire family for four months in the city. Later, he returned to serve as president of 2009 Tokyo festival jury. 

                    This year, Iñárritu is arriving in Japan with dual duties. He will both screen his first feature in seven years (and his first fully Mexico movie since Amores Perros) — the epic, phantasmagoric comedy drama Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths — and he will attend a glitzy gala at Tokyo’s Imperial Hotel to receive the festival’s Kurosawa Akira award for lifetime achievement.  
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Produced by Netflix, Bardo began a limited release in U.S. theaters on Thursday, ahead of its global launch on the platform on Dec. 16. 
                    
                    Daniel Giménez Cacho stars in the film as Silverio Gama, a renowned Mexican journalist and documentary filmmaker living in Los Angeles. When he returns to his native country after being named the recipient of a prestigious international award, Silverio finds himself tripping into an inward existential exploration as he contemplates his family relationships, questions of cultural identity and changes to the country of his birth. 
                    
                    Ahead of his arrival in Tokyo on Saturday, The Hollywood Reporter connected with Iñárritu for a discussion of Bardo and his relationship with Japan. 
                    
                    First of all, congratulations on the film. I really enjoyed it — just the joy of submitting to its flow. There are so many big ideas and astounding images. It’s a film that requires multiple viewings. I was hoping we could talk about the writing process of this film, because for a number of reasons, it was kind of hard for me to imagine how it was written. For one, I couldn’t really discern any conventional story structure. Also, although it’s a work of fiction, it feels like such a deeply personal work, so it’s interesting picturing how you went about collaborating with your co-writer on this material. And then, so many of the film’s big ideas are expressed in surrealistic visuals. How did writing this film compare to your other films? 
                    
                    
                    You know, it’s interesting that you thought about that in the genesis of it, because it was never all that different from other projects that I have done. But, in a more conventional, or rationally structured film, it’s true that there’s a process, or a recipe, already there to guide you — so that you can start building something vertically, let’s say. But this one came from a very different place. Basically, all the other films I have made with my eyes open, and whatever it was that I was constructing was manifested on the outside — and whatever it made me feel, or whatever I thought about it, I was relating to a reality that I saw on the outside. With this film, basically, the process was, I had the need to close my eyes. When you close your eyes, obviously, then you look inward — and that’s a much more complex territory. These introspections are a bit more chaotic. All those things that I was seeing and feeling, all of the memories, images and contradictions that came with it — it was like an involuntary memory and it was very uncomfortable, with no order, with no structure. So for four years, I was just putting down things that were meaningful to me. But then, the problem was that the fabric of this film is very abstract. This film doesn’t have any structure; it just has an emotional center of gravity, basically. So, then it was a process of taking all those things that I understood deeply with my heart — not with my mind in any kind of rational way — and making a sequence that, in a way, represents that emotional material. So what I’m saying is, it came from the subconscious — and we cannot overestimate the subconscious. 
                    
                    
                    Because it comes from such a personal place — and involves ideas, emotions and images you’ve been grappling with for such a long time — I’m curious to hear what it feels like to have gotten it out. To have processed all that, and to have realized it.
                    
                    It has been a journey. When Nicolás Giacobone and I were putting the script together, he became kind of a therapist. It was deep introspection that came out as an intimate auto-fiction. I let myself go. I think at my current age, I’m stronger now and I can laugh about myself. I approach most things with humor, in order to illuminate the pain or understand it. So the script writing was a sensitive process, but then when you go to make it, you just have to execute it. The complexity of this film has been the most challenging filmmaking I have ever done in my life — much more than The Revenant, by far. Because every single frame, and every single movement was completely pre-visualized and rehearsed. It was incredibly complex, but it was done with complete control. So I really needed to do a lot of physical work to achieve that. You become like a doctor who is doing open-heart surgery. You cannot get emotional, you just need to be incredibly effective and pragmatic. The patient can die if you get emotional. And then, obviously, you have to put it out into the world — this thing you have been constructing in an incredibly intimate, interior space. It feels vulnerable. But I have a very positive feeling of affirmation with this film. So yes, you do expose yourself, but there is nothing to hide. I also believe that we are all connected by the same emotions, so I’m sure that even though this film is made up of very personal feelings and perspectives, there are universal themes and feelings that many people will connect with. 
                    
                    
                    
                    One of the feelings that I connected with, which the film expresses so profoundly and in so many subtle and interesting ways, is the idea that you can never really go back once you’ve left your home country for a long period. It will never be the same. I’m American but I’ve been living outside the U.S. for about 17 years. So, setting aside issues of career and family practicalities, I wondered whether part of you ever wishes you never left Mexico — because the film is suffused with such a complicated longing for your country. Are the gifts of perception that come with living abroad, in that in-between space, worth it?
                    
                    I don’t really regret it. I’m pretty comfortable and I have integrated. It has taken me a while, and there have been a lot of mountains and valleys, with pain and laughter. But I think there is a lot of opportunity and growth that we have gone through as a family — along with the contradictions, uncertainties and doubts. But overall, it is a privilege to live abroad. For you, as an American, to have left your country, I think that has given you an amazing perspective and a chance to grow interiorly as a human being. Because when you go away, you become a more rounded human being, and you are less closed in by the walls of ideology and national narratives — many of which are invisible until you are outside of them. Those narrative are also great, because they give you a sense of identity, belonging and collective power. But when you get out, there’s a third eye that emerges, and gradually you begin to see things a bit more three-dimensionally, right? So, you are separated, but in a strange way you feel a bit more fulfilled. There is a price to pay for this, but, no, I would not change any of that. 
                    
                    
                    I think it can be very hard for many Americans to get outside their bubble, because it’s a very self-serving culture. You can go anywhere in the world and expect everyone to speak your own language, and it’s a very sustainable ideology and culture that fulfills most of your needs. So, it’s sometimes very difficult for American people to grasp the emotion that we are talking about here. But that’s what I have attempted to do with this film. And even if some people cannot relate to it, I think there are millions of immigrants around the world who know this feeling. It doesn’t matter if you are Mexican or American, or privileged or not. When you lose your roots, this is what it feels like. 
                    
                    Films and works of fiction about artists inwardly interrogating their origins, memories, country and legacy could be said to make up a genre of a kind. It probably has a name, but it’s escaping me. When you were working on this film, did you look to any past works that had pursued similar aims? Or did you avoid influence as much as possible and just go inward, as you described?
                    
                    You know, it has been very difficult for me to try to explain the line between fiction and reality with this film. In a way, it’s a dialectical film; it plays with dialectics, dualities and coexistence. I think two things can be real and co-existing at the same time simultaneously, without one canceling the other. That’s the reality of the world. We have become very binary-brained creatures, which is destroying us because our reality is much more complex than the one that we would like to perceive comfortably. For me, all biographies are lies and our own lives are a fiction. The narratives that we put together to accommodate our own interests or needs, as a nation or as a person — all of those dots that we try to string together could be interpreted in many different ways. And I think there’s a lot of hypocrisy when you say, “This is what happened.” Because memory does not have truth, it just has emotional conviction, just as the character says in the film. And that’s why I said it is an auto-fiction, because I think fiction has much more possibility to reveal what reality is hiding. So when you consider events, you have to betray them in order to get to a higher truth. You must go looking for something that’s even more meaningful and real. But you don’t say, “Oh, this fact.” It’s about what the fact means and how those things are connected. Again, you need to have this third eye to really observe reality as it is. So that’s what I tried to do here — navigating between reality and fiction, to uncover things that I could not have seen or said if I were simply trying to state the facts. 
                    
                    
                    I did find myself wondering why you chose to have your protagonist be a journalist and a documentarian, rather than, say, a filmmaker or a visual artist of some kind. Were there similar motivations to this decision? 
                    
                    Yeah, I think that’s part of what I was saying. Most filmmakers work in fictional worlds, but at the same time, I have been challenged to do a lot of research as a filmmaker. When you do that first period of writing on some subjects, you can end up doing some real journalistic work — interviewing people and getting access to situations and different kinds of worlds. It’s serving a fiction, but it’s journalistic activity and material. I did that for Carne y Arena (Flesh and Sand), which was a virtual reality installation I did about immigrants. I did a lot of research and interviews. So those immigrant themes that I have talked about in my other movies, you know, suddenly, I felt that there’s a kind of dual reality, where fiction is always the source that feeds reality. I was interested in that idea. So, I have Silverio navigating these two worlds freely, as both a journalist and as the guy who is more interested in fiction, which is what he’s becoming. He is questioning what is true and what is not — and that all comes out in that discussion he has on the terrace with that other TV journalist guy. 
                    
                    I loved that scene… So, is it true that you cut 22 minutes from the film after the Venice and Telluride screenings?
                    
                    Yeah, absolutely. 
                    
                    
                    What prompted you to do that and what was the process like? 
                    
                    You know, the visual effects arrived very late. Basically, two days before going to Venice, I finished the film. So I never had the opportunity to really watch the film with an audience. I was still very close to it. So when I arrived in Venice, it was the very first time that I saw it in front of a big group of people. And, you know, I realized that it was an opportunity for me to get into some scenes a little later, and to get out of others a little earlier — to introduce a little more muscle and internal rhythm. Honestly, the people who saw the original film probably will not even notice the changes. The film is intact, essentially, it just lost a little weight. It’s the same person, it’s just a little bit thinner. I’m very happy about that.
                    
                    So the film is opening in a lot of cinemas in Mexico this week. What are your hopes and feelings for the Mexican release?
                    
                    At the heart, this is a very Mexican film. In a way, I tried not only to recoup personal memories, but to grasp some of the collective memories of our country and society — about the conquests that happened 500 years ago and remain an open wound. I tried to synthesize in a cinematic way a lot of the things that have left eternal scars and still have a lot of emotional impact on us. Like the American invasion in 1846 that cost us half of our country. In the United States, they don’t even really teach the kids about that story. It’s not something that is forgotten; it happened very recently and the consequences have been crazy. And all of the people disappearing in our country — some 120,000 people have disappeared in the last 10 years, with no information about what happened to them. So all of these scars and events — together with my intimate events, in a different way — have a lot of meaning for our society. The people responded beautifully at the Morelia Film Festival and I could see the connection the film has with our emotions. I was blown away by the reception. 
                    
                    
                    So, the fact that the film is opening in Mexico on more than 500 screens, including IMAX, seven weeks before it goes on the platform — I’m so grateful and happy about that, because it was made to be a very cinematic experience. If you demand from this film a very logical structure — like the usual three acts — you are going to be frustrated. Like you said at the beginning of this interview, you “surrendered to the flow of the film.” That’s the way to approach it. It’s a cinematic experience to immerse yourself in. Cinema is a dream being directed, as Buñuel said. If you ask this film for the same structure of the TV series you have been binging, you will be fighting with it. Just go and get lost and forget about the world and yourself for a couple hours. 
                    
                    So, I want to talk a little about the honor you’re getting in Tokyo. You’ve had quite a long relationship with this festival. Your very first film, Amores Perros, won awards here and later you headed the jury. And, of course, a big portion of Babel was shot in the city. Do you feel you have developed a connection with Tokyo? And what does winning an award named after Akira Kurosawa mean to you?
                    
                    All of those things you mentioned are such great memories for me.  When I came with Amores Perros, as a young filmmaker — well, actually not so young, I was 35 years old already — but it was a huge surprise, because we actually won two awards. At the time, they had previously only given one award per film. It was very meaningful for me, because back then — I don’t know if they still do it — they gave a $100,000 prize to the grand prix winner for best film. And I didn’t earn one cent from directing Amores Perros; I actually put my own money into it and never got any money out of it myself. So I was in debt and really in need of money. So, wow, winning $100,000 — that sounded incredible to me. So when they announced during the awards ceremony that I had won best director, I went on stage and I was very happy, but at the same time I was thinking, “Shit, I guess this means I didn’t win best film.” (Laughs) So when they read out that Amores Perros had also won the grand prix, I was super surprised because I didn’t think it would be possible. And it was a beautiful honor — but it also provided so much relief to me in my personal life. 
                    
                    
                    And when I shot part of Babel over four months in Tokyo, I have to say, it was one of the happiest times in my life. I felt so comfortable there. I don’t know what it is. It’s such a beautiful culture and so civilized — there’s something very profound about spending time in a place that is so pleasant but where you don’t understand anything. I was just always so fascinated. So, anyways, I have a lot of wonderful memories in Tokyo. 
                    
                    And what can one say about Kurosawa? I think he is one of the top three or four gods of cinema. Every single frame and the humanity and aesthetic power he had as a storyteller — he’s just a giant. To receive this award under his name means something very, very profound to me. .</p>

              <div class="custom-scrollbar-css p-2">
                <p class="font-italic">Just as their film Everything Everywhere All at Once passes $100 million at the global box office, becoming the biggest commercial success for indie outfit A24, directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are signing a long-term pact with Universal. The duo (known as the Daniels) and their producer, Jonathan Wang, have inked a five-year exclusive partnership with the studio.

                  “Daniels are creators who have evolved their craft with a distinct vision and singular voice that is unmistakable across the spectrum of content vying for viewer’s attention,” said Donna Langley, chairman, Universal film group. “Their films are remarkably theatrical and with only two original projects under their belts, they’ve merely scratched the surface of what they are capable of as filmmakers. We’re grateful they’ve chosen to go on their journey with us.”
                  
      
                  The studio previously signed Jordan Peele to a five-year exclusive agreement in 2019 after having worked together on his Oscar-winning feature directorial debut, Get Out, and his follow-up Us. The first movie Peele directed under that pact, Nope, was recently released in theaters, earning $44 million over its opening weekend with a current domestic gross of $80 million.
                  
                  “We’re flattered, grateful, and a bit overwhelmed. Thanks to Donna, Jimmy, Peter, Michael and their whole Universal team for believing in us and our weird movies,” said the Daniels. “To all the fans, thanks for making our careers possible, we’re gonna try to not let you down.”
                  
                  The directors broke out with their work in music videos, including the viral video for DJ Snake and Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for What.” They made their feature directorial debut with the Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe movie Swiss Army Man, which was also released by A24. It was recently announced that the duo will direct and executive produce half-hour comedy Mason for A24 and Showtime, starring comedian Nathan Min.

              <div class="custom-scrollbar-css p-2">
                <p class="font-italic">or the past few days, I’ve seen the Women Talking team everywhere: Mingling at a welcome brunch deep in the mountains, rushing down Colorado Avenue on the way to their next thing, taking their seats for the Empire of Light premiere. They travel in a pack, often with big smiles and bigger laughs. And why wouldn’t they? Sarah Polley’s powerful new film, swiftly met with raves after its premiere here in Telluride, has been the talk of the festival, and represents creative highs for everyone from its Oscar-nominated writer-director to its peerless ensemble. None of them, even legendary producer-star Frances McDormand, have had an experience like this before. The film is fully made by and centered on women, and has been unveiled to the world with the team behind it united as a collective, a group of artists rightly proud of what they’ve done.

                  A guide to Hollywood’s biggest races
                  
                  Adapted from the Miriam Toews novel, Women Talking is set in a remote, present-day Mennonite colony operating under an archaic patriarchal system. The story’s catalyst arrives as young Autje (Kate Hallett) catches one man brutally attacking a woman; the women of the colony are finally awoken to the violence and cruelty they’ve been subjected to throughout their lives, that they’d been led to believe were random acts of God. And so now, they must gather and talk about it, in an isolated hayloft—to decide whether to stand their ground and fight the men who’ve so wronged them, or leave together toward the great unknown. Out of this setup, which Polley renders with rich and surprising cinematic intensity, characters prove distinctive in their beliefs, faith, and dreams—from Jessie Buckley’s cynical Mariche to Claire Foy’s ferocious Salome to Rooney Mara’s measured Ona. A cathartic conversation emerges, about asserting one’s personhood (specifically, womanhood) while working methodically toward rousing collective action, with hope for a better tomorrow.
                  
                
                  As I sat with the Women Talking team on a few benches under a tent, just outside the Werner Herzog theater on a warm Sunday afternoon, I was struck by how much our discussion mirrored what we see in the film: The laughs shared between these collaborators, the tears shed at one point. There was even a lone man (disclosure: this writer) listening to and recording what they have to say. (In the film, it’s Ben Whishaw’s sensitive ally, August, who takes the meeting’s minutes.) Indeed, entering this new territory for all of these women has translated to a movie, and a conversation, like we’ve never seen.
                  
                  
                  Michelle McLeod stars as Mejal, Sheila McCarthy as Greta, Liv McNeil as Neitje, Jessie Buckley as Mariche, Claire Foy as Salome, Kate Hallett as Autje, Rooney Mara as Ona, and Judith Ivey as Agata.MICHAEL GIBSON
                  Vanity Fair: Watching the movie, it felt like something I’d never seen before. I imagine it felt like that making it as well. Jessie, to start, can you speak to that and whether it felt so new?
                  
          
                  
                  
                  Jessie Buckley: I’ve never been on a set where I get to not just play, but to experience, with nine extraordinary women. Explore what that relationship means between us in a world, and how we can move forward together—not just on our own, but with people that we love, and move out of the place we’re in. We don’t know what we might find within ourselves and between each other. I’ve never read a script like that, yeah, where I can explore the complex, rich, knotty, difficult, beautiful parts of female friendship like that, and actually use it as catharsis, as something to understand between each other and from each other.
                  
                  Frances, you’ve made quite a few films, and in this case of course had more of a behind-the-scenes role. What about this felt special and unique for you?

                  Frances McDormand: I’m 65. I’m the oldest.
                  
                  Sheila McCarthy: [Raises hand] 66.
                  
                  McDormand: Damn it! [Laughs] Well, we have four or maybe even five generations— decades—of experience here. That’s a huge part of it. I’ve been in ensemble films before. I’ve never been in ensemble films where it was mostly women, but I’ve always abhorred “women films” where they end up singing into a hairbrush or wooden spoon, because I don’t do that with my friends. We actually talk about science and the economy and things of that nature. The exciting thing that happened in the development was, our producing partner Dede [Gardner] and I would often use sports-movie metaphors with Sarah. “Where’s the big triumph?” She kind of went, “I don’t think women’s stories are told that way.” So then, “What’s the alternative?” This movie is the alternative. You haven’t seen it before because it hasn’t been explored. 
                  
                  
                  We were just having a whole long conversation about films that were seen in the festival that have main female protagonists but are still trapped in the old paradigms of storytelling. It’s unknown territory and we’re out there. We’re swimming in it along with you and everybody else.
                  
                  Sarah, I was at the tribute screening on Friday and one of the themes that emerged is your interest in how we tell stories. This movie feels like a kind of statement in that regard. Can you talk about the attraction to the material, and getting to this point as a filmmaker, in that context?
                  
                  Sarah Polley: I love that so much of the film is them finding words for things, or saying things that capture a collective feeling around a different kind of experience or challenge. Why I was so interested in this book is that it’s also about, How do you tell this story of where you’re going, which is where you come from? We’re getting better, culturally, at telling the stories of where we’ve come from and where the harms have been, and we have to continue to do that until there’s a full picture. The act of imagining, “What's the story that we want to move toward?” is one that gets largely left out of the conversation. I was thrilled by the hope in that and the imagination in that.
                  
                  What I love about this movie is that each of your characters are so distinctive, they all bring their own voices and perspectives and arguments to the central question of the movie. You had a few weeks of rehearsal. In the getting-to-know-each other, did you develop roles within the ensemble along similar lines? Claire, I see you’re laughing.
                  
                  Claire Foy: Yeah. It happens naturally in any group, but I had never been in a group where all of those people in those roles—the leader, etc—was a woman. I found it dynamic and unpredictable and really, really deep at moments. I went to spaces I don’t think I ever would’ve gone if the environment would have been different. We all had something different to offer. That could lead to conflict, but that was really interesting, that we were able to do that within an environment where we were all offering something. It didn’t feel like Sarah was some sort of megalomaniac director. There was a conversation, constantly.
                  
                  
                  McCarthy: We were also in the confines of COVID world. So we were all locked together for all these months. Literally we saw nobody else.
                  
                  You got to know each other well.
                  
                  McCarthy: We did. And so what was happening in our one big general group dressing room was also happening on set, our relationships really bled into the filming, I think as well.
                  
                  Polley: Dr. Lori Haskell works in trauma and with memory. Her work is incredibly important. She was a huge resource to all of us, both in terms of the research for the film but also as a presence and a container for a lot of us.
                  
                  “Claire had done that monologue at full tilt, full tilt off camera 120 times.” —Sarah Polley
                  
                  To that point, you’re running many long, intense scenes here. How many takes would you get on average?
                  
                  Polley: I’ll give you an example of one scene, which is where Claire has her first big monologue when the camera pushes in. We didn’t do tons of takes on each person, but just the number of relationships we need to cover in dynamics—we shot that scene for two and a half days, and we realized at the end of it that Claire had done that monologue at full tilt, full tilt off camera 120 times. So it wasn’t humane actually. And then I remember that night watching this video of the captain of the Canadian women’s soccer team, who kept on playing through a broken nose, and the team was crowding around her and hugging her, thanking her. I was just thinking, “It’s Claire.”
                  
                  Foy: But then we learned after that. That was what was amazing about it, strategically going, “There’s this big bit that’s coming up, let’s try and stop shooting there so that the next day we can come back and everyone’s fresh,” as opposed to someone having to do these massive pages of dialogue together. But those first few days...
                  
                  Polley: I had to change the way I was shooting it after that. I think that was an eye opener for me, where I was running 15-page scenes over and over and over again. There was one day where Sheila—and this just reveals it would be good for me to shadow an episodic television director at some point—came up to me and went, “Hey Sarah, do you think we could do a pickup for this one?” And I went, “Oh, oh sure, no problem. Thank you, Sheila.”
                  
                  McCarthy: Like, “It's just for Jessie’s closeup. Do you really need me to get there?”
                  
                  
                  In these heavy scenes, characters recount some of their darkest experiences in the colony. Claire, your last monologue is particularly remarkable, I would say, to watch. When I saw it at the tribute screening, you could hear a pin drop. It was just complete, utter silence and focus. How do you get to that place as an actor?
                  
                  Foy: I’d spoken to Sarah about that quite a lot. It was quite interesting because she would just say, “I trust you.” And I’d go, “No, I need you to tell me how to do it.” We were all really prepared as actors, I think because we knew the scale of the task, but also we knew how much we all depended on each other. I was continually surprised by the things I was seeing the other actors in the room do, which helped me to no end: seeing people and how they had interpreted the material on what they were doing.
                  
                  That scene, I knew I couldn’t do it a million times and I’d already said that to Sarah. We only did it like three times, I think. Knowing that it was okay, that after that I didn’t have to be like, “Ahhh!” But I don’t know—I genuinely don’t really know what happened. Really. It was one of those things that, I just did it. I did it and trusted it and trusted that it would be all right and that it was all there.
                  
                  McDormand: And it’s interesting how often we don't get to trust it as actors go into things, how often we have to protect ourselves from things that aren’t as well-grounded and well-written and well-directed and well-led. We have to learn how to trust every time.
                  
                  I have a thing about laughter in movies, where a lot of times it feels very forced to me. And in this one, every time you all break out into laughter, it is so incredibly authentic and gratifying, I think, for the audience. I’ve never heard an audience laugh with all the actors as much as in that screening. Michelle, I know you have a comedy background: What were those moments like and what, from your perspective as an actor, was so important about releasing that tension?
                  
                  Michelle McLeod: Well, that’s exactly what it is. You have to have that lightness to all of this as well. That does break the tension. Rooney Mara is a genius. She brought a fart machine on set but no one guessed it was her for a very long time. We heard this fucking raunchy fart out of nowhere. I thought for sure, it was a crew member. I almost peed my pants laughing. And then I couldn’t figure out where these noises were coming from, and I looked over at Rooney—she’s very quiet. Nobody knows. And she starts laughing, and finally she reveals, she has hidden a fart machine.
                  
                  Rooney Mara: Laughing is harder than crying. So much harder. And after doing that scene 120 times, I was like, How are we supposed to laugh? Over a hundred takes. It’s just going to be so fake—and it’s so important that it’s real. So I ordered a few different fart machines.
                  
                  
                  
                  McCarthy: This whole article’s going to be about fart machines.
                  
                  Mara: We pulled that thing out later on in the hayloft set, too, when we really needed it. But I will say that Michelle has one laugh in the movie that’s not from my fart machine.
                  
                  Polley: They would all help each other with laughing in different scenes. And at some point I said to Ben, who was helping Jessie laugh in quite incredible ways, “Oh, Michelle has a laugh coming up. Can you help?” And then after the first take, he’s like, “She doesn’t need my help.”
                  
                  McLeod: I think I just generally can entertain myself. People may say I’m crazy. But honestly I tell myself jokes all the time and I laugh.
                  
                  McDormand: Sarah asked Miriam really early on, “What do you want? Give me your directive?” And she said, “Remember the women’s faith and their sense of humor.” That’s what the collective does. You don’t just get the laundry done. You keep yourself afloat.
                  
                  “I was like, How are we supposed to laugh? So I ordered a few different fart machines.” —Rooney Mara
                  
                  Kate and Liv, you play the children in the hayloft, listening in and observing these women and their conversation. What did you take away from the experience?
                  
                  Hallett: I felt like I learned by being there and they were all just so open to answering questions. I went up to Rooney after one day and I was like, “How do you even do that?” And she was just like, “I don't even know. I just kind of do it.” I was like, “That is a great approach.”
                  
                  Liv McNeil: I feel like we embodied our characters as well because Neitje and Autje are outside observers, and that’s exactly what Kate and I were the entire time, just sitting and watching and learning. My character was pretty disconnected. I was kind of forced into just listening, and I felt like that shaped it for me.
                  
                  McDormand: Your reading of “this is so boring” was so good. And I'm thinking, now, Were you ever bored?
                  
                  Buckley: Oh my God.
                  
                  McDormand: Well, you’re all in a big room together, but you have to sit there for a long time! It must have been boring sometimes.
                  
                  Kate: It’s hard to be bored when you’re watching them. [Group laughs]
                  
                  Polley: It was very interesting. It felt like there was this constant theme for me of watching actors surprise themselves. You’d see something happen and then you could see a look in there, like, “I didn’t know I was going to do that.” And that was so thrilling because there were just these moments that nobody was expecting to come out of them.
                  
                  Did you have such a moment, Jessie?
                  
                  Buckley: Yeah, many. And I wanted to have that experience. Even though all these characters have very particular points of view, I didn’t want to prejudge what they might experience in the moment when you’re working with such incredibly truthful, brilliant, amazing people in a room where you really can let yourself just go and let yourself be surprised.
                  
                  McDormand: Constructive competition. [Group laughs] We were rehearsing at one point and we realized that it was going to always be this concentrated circle, and that August was always going to be over there at his table. At one point, Ben came over—and nobody was struggling with their look at all; everybody was really into their look—and he was just like [mouths, “You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful.” So genuine. He meant it. And then he went back to his corner.
                  
                  
                  McLeod: Ben has heard things no man ever has.
                  
                  Foy: He could write a book.
                  
                  Sarah, can you talk a little bit about changing the narration from August’s, as it is in the book,  for the movie? And particularly ending on a poignant line that sums up the movie really beautifully, I thought.
                  
                  Polley: That was a really collective process between Fran and Dede and me and Kate and Christopher Donaldson, our editor. There was a point in the edit where we realized we needed to hear it through a woman’s voice and we were trying to decide who that is. It was Chris who went, “You keep wanting me to get the camera on Kate. What about Kate?” Hearing it from the youngest person in the room and the idea of telling the story of this future—I was really scared of it at first and it required me to go into a lot of space by myself and go into my thoughts at 16. And I’d been wanting to keep the film here and my life here, and that was where my life bled into the film a little bit. Writing that narration for me was the hardest part, and then hearing it through Kate’s voice was the best part. Writing that narration was a whole film into itself for me.
                  
                  
                  Sheila, you have one gorgeous scene in which you apologize to Jessie, who plays your daughter, Mariche. It’s incredibly complex. To your early point, Fran, it illustrates generational differences between these women. Very broadly, how did you go into it? What was it like playing it together?
                  
                  McCarthy: In the hayloft we were allowed such freedom and such truth with each other, and having been there for two days and seeing the hurt and finally, maybe for the first time, understanding what [my daughter] been going through, it was an enormous penny dropping for a mother to have spent her whole life with this child. She’s been in love with this girl since the day she was born, but we’ve been living this very rigid, very repressed, very  misogynistic world.
                  
               
                  
                  Buckley: I was scared because I think in that moment, the generational things that we’ve learned— the chain has to be cut. And from that moment it changed.
                  
                  McCarthy: We’re on entirely new ground.
                  
                  Buckley: Which is scary, unknown ground. This is something which we’ve always understood about ourselves. This is how we survive. This is how we get up in the morning and go to bed at night. This is how I see you. This is how I’ve always seen you. And this is how you see me. And actually in one moment, it’s like I see somebody completely different. And I can see myself differently for the first time. That’s really scary.
                  
                  I would think that shooting it chronologically also gives you that building, where you get to a moment like that, both in the story and in the filming, where you reach new ground and it's scary.
                  
                  McCarthy: Because that was never found in rehearsals. You’re right.
                  
                  McDormand: Can I ask you something that I don’t know and I can't remember—is it once in the script? Did you add two more?
                  
                  Polley: Yeah, so that moment for me was the biggest pivot in the adaptation because that doesn’t happen in the book, but I realized it all hinges on whether she’s going to move or not. I had just read all of this amazing work by Harriet Lerner on apologies, this book called, Why Won’t You Apologize? It’s about, What does a great apology look like? How can it transform a person? And how can you move forward out of harm? I’ve been doing all of this thinking and talking about apologies. And so then I suddenly realized Mariche can’t move until someone gives her the right apology. We shot it and we had some crew members who had come from backgrounds with abuse, backgrounds in devoutly religious communities where abuses have been repressed. I remember there was something missing in the writing. I literally turned to one of our crew members who came from this background and I said, “Would that be good enough for you?” He had been sobbing through the whole scene, and he just said, “No, I need more.” And I said, “What do you need?” And he said, “I need her to say, I’m sorry.” And so I said to Sheila, “If you feel like you have to say you’re sorry, say it. But don’t say it if you don't feel like you have to. Hold it in.” Then Sheila just said it three times. The idea, it wasn’t in the script. Sheila just did that spontaneously.
                  
                  McDormand: [Crying] And that’s what forgiveness is. You don’t decide to make a movie about forgiveness. How can you really do that? It comes out of the experience of a group of people creating that.
                  
                  Polley: It was just so many people finding that moment together. And just to finish the story, because I forgot what the main part was. Then that crew member said, “That would be good enough for me. If my parents could say that to me, I’d be okay.”
                  
                 
                  
                  Foy: Something we said a lot when we were shooting was not to slip into sentimentality. Not that we thought any of us were, but I think that because you are doing such emotional things all the time, there’s a truth to how people communicate and a truth to trauma, which is that people aren’t always able to articulate it.
                  
                  Polley: You were so disciplined with that. Even Claire’s big monologue that you were talking about—I said to Claire, “How are you feeling about it?” And she said, “I’m so frustrated with myself because there’s tears.” What other actor is like, “Oh fuck, the tears”? There was this active desire to not do the obvious thing. It’s so good watching someone fight that.
                  
                  McCarthy: And that makes you do the tears.
                  
                  Foy: That’s all these women have— is words. We act out so much of the emotion on each other in life, anyway. “Don’t tell me what we’re going to do, show me.” But in this, they have to articulate it. They have such a huge responsibility. It's like the United Nations or something. They have to be able to speak to each other and get their point across so they can all be heard.
                  
                  Buckley: This is sort of Women Talking. [To me] Take some minutes! [Group laughs]
                  
                  If I can be Ben Whishaw for a day, I’m happy.
                  
                  McCarthy: In the last 24 hours, since our screening, I don't know if this is pertinent, but I’ve been in lines to the loo, with women who have seen the movie and they can’t talk. A lot of the women just said, ugh. And then they’re filled with emotion.
                  
                  Buckley: And men.
                  
                  McCarthy: And men too, you’re right.
                  
                  McDormand: I had a great conversation with a couple, late 30s, man, woman. He was saying he saw it with his wife, her mother, and her grandmother. And that at the end of it, his position was that he really wanted them to kill [Mariche’s abusive husband] Klaus. He wanted someone to go back and kill Klaus and they were like, “Oh, no, no, no, no, you really missed the point.” And so they all really wanted to keep the conversation going. It was so great to see it still happening. And that was the next day. They were still engaged in the talking.</p>

              <div class="custom-scrollbar-css p-2">
                <p class="font-italic">Damien Chazelle has been working on the story for Babylon, at least in his head, ever since he first moved to Los Angeles around 15 years ago. “The basic idea was just to do a big, epic, multicharacter movie, set in these early days of Los Angeles and Hollywood, when both of these things were coming into what we now think of them as,” he tells Vanity Fair in his first interview about the film, which is due out from Paramount this December.

                  A guide to Hollywood’s biggest races
                  
                  The 1920s were a pivotal moment in Hollywood history. Los Angeles was transforming into a metropolis, and the movie industry—making the uncertain transition from silent films to the talkies—was bursting with people angling for fame, wealth, and power.
                  
                 
                  
                  A decade and a half ago, Chazelle had none of those things as an aspiring writer-director who had recently moved to LA. He had not yet had his breakout Sundance debut with Whiplash—which went on to win J.K. Simmons a best-supporting-actor Oscar for his turn as an explosive jazz instructor—nor had he become the youngest person to ever win the best-director Oscar, for La La Land. “I kept putting it off, because it was just a little too massive,” Chazelle says of the project. He finally tackled the screenplay after finishing his 2018 film First Man, with Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong.
                  
          
                  
                  
                  Based on early footage and images, Babylon looks to be a lavish romp through Hollywood’s nascent Golden Age, starring a brash Brad Pitt, an uninhibited Margot Robbie, and newcomer Diego Calva. But beneath the glitz and glamour, Chazelle wanted Babylon to underscore the fact that the town’s rapid change and growth came at a price. “Everything is shifting underneath people’s feet,” he says, “and I became really fascinated by the human cost of disruption at that magnitude, at a time when there was no road map, when everything was just new and wild.”
                  
                  
                  Casting two of Hollywood’s biggest movie stars in Babylon’s lead roles made sense thematically, as well as financially. Pitt and Robbie, who starred together in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, play actors at very different points in their careers, and Chazelle knew his stars would see echoes of their own lives in the parts. “Part of what was magical about working with them in these roles is that each of them felt like they were really able to make the performance the most personal thing they had done,” he says.
                  
                  The majority of characters in Babylon are fictional, though Chazelle took inspiration from real-life Hollywood stars. Pitt’s character, Jack Conrad, is a hard-partying “über-movie star,” as Chazelle puts it, inspired by the likes of John Gilbert, Clark Gable, and Douglas Fairbanks: “He’s reaching a point in his life in his career where he’s starting to look back and starting to wonder what’s ahead.” (Pitt expressed a similar sentiment about his own work in a recent GQ cover story.)
                  
                  
                  As for Robbie, she’s playing Nellie LaRoy, a scrappy aspiring actress who’s an amalgam of early stars like Clara Bow, Jeanne Eagels, Joan Crawford, and Alma Rubens. Nellie is a new Hollywood transplant who’s suddenly in the spotlight, an experience that the Wolf of Wall Street’s breakout could relate to. “Margot as a person has this—it’s a very Australian sort of thing—brash, bold, hungry kind of edge to her that she was really able to tap into and do a lot of really fun things with,” says Chazelle.
                  
                  Calva, the cast’s newcomer, plays Manny Torres, a Mexican immigrant who, as an outsider in Hollywood, serves as the audience’s eyes in the world of Babylon. Says Chazelle, “In many ways, he was going through a very similar experience to the character he was playing as well, of just stumbling on a larger-than-life campus and going, ‘What the fuck is going on?’”

                  Babylon’s rich supporting cast—including Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li, Jean Smart, and Tobey Maguire—also play fictional characters (the only named real-life person in the main ensemble is producer Irving Thalberg, played by Max Minghella), whose dreams of fame and success rest on navigating a perilous town.
                  
                 
                  
                 
                  Chazelle brought together many of his past collaborators, including cinematographer Linus Sandgren and composer Justin Hurwitz, who both won Oscars for La La Land. He had in mind a movie packed with spectacle that reflected the extravagance and hedonism of the era: “I wanted to capture just how big and bold and brash and unapologetic that world was.”
                  
                  
                  But Chazelle wanted to plumb the lower depths too—to juxtapose La La Land’s gorgeous, Hollywood-glam set pieces and Whiplash’s darker examination of ambition’s toll. “It was really a wild West period for these people, this gallery of characters, as they rise and fall, rise, fall, rise again, fall again,” he says, adding that “the thing that they’re building is springing back on them and chewing them up.”
                   
                  Expect a story that explores the multiple levels of transformation, from the city itself to the industry, and the people hoping to make it big. Chazelle references the “headlong, heedless ambition” of that time as a central theme of his movie. And not coincidentally, he says Babylon is his most ambitious work yet: “It was definitely the hardest thing I’ve done. Just the logistics of it, the number of characters, the scale of the set pieces, the span of time that the movie charts—it all conspired to make it particularly challenging, but it was a challenge that was pretty exciting to take on.”</p>
